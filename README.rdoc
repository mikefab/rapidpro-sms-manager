Rapidpro flows can be configured with webhooks that forward the content of sms responses to a url. This application runs separate from Rapidpro and is designed to receive these responses.

This application has two parts: 

1. It diagrams the results of surveys. 
   Live demo: http://askliberia.herokuapp.com/


2. It has an interface for managing rumors. A live demo will be available shortly.
